# Neuron-Simulations
Neuronal dynamics simulations in Python.

Here are a few example plots (more found under [/Plots](https://github.com/lucasmccabe/Neuron-Simulations/tree/master/Plots)):

The leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model is described [here](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.738).

The Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model is described [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764/epdf).
